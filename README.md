 HTML document with Bootstrap and a simple text-to-speech functionality. Here's an overview of your code:

i included the necessary HTML structure for a webpage, specifying the document's language and including the required meta tags.

i included the Bootstrap CSS framework using a link tag to style your page.

i also included the Font Awesome CSS for icons.

In the style section, you have defined some CSS rules:

i defined a CSS rule for an element with the class "text" to set its height and width.
i set the width of the button to "fit-content."
i added a CSS rule to change the border and outline when a textarea is focused.
Inside the body section, you've created a container with a centered row and column using Bootstrap classes. Inside this column, you have placed a textarea and a button.

i added an event listener to the button with the id "btn." When the button is clicked, it triggers the speech synthesis functionality, reading the content of the textarea aloud.

Finally, i have included the Bootstrap JavaScript bundle for client-side functionality.# Text-to-Speech-convert
